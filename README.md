# Violent Political Rheotric on Twitter


## About

Violent hostility between ordinary partisans is undermining American democracy. Social media, once touted as democratizing technology, is blamed for political rhetoric threatening violence against political opponents and implicated in extremist offline political violence. Focusing on Twitter, I propose an automated method to detect such rhetoric and investigate its characteristics. Using a data set spanning a 16-week period surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election, I demonstrate a) violent tweets peak in the days preceding the Capitol Riot, testifying their close relevance to contentious offline politics, b) violent tweets disproportionately target women and Republican politicians, c) violent tweets are rare but spread widely, reaching an audience without a direct tie to violent users, d) violent users are ideologically extreme and on the fringe of the communication network, e) violent tweets are shared primarily among like-minded users but exhibit cross-ideological spread as well.
