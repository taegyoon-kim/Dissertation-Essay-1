# Violent Political Rheotric on Twitter


## About

Recently, concerns are raised about the violent nature of political communication on social media: many social media platforms are exploited by users who write posts threatening violence against political opponents as part of normalized expression of radical partisanship. 

Focusing on Twitter, I develop a method for automatic detection of violent political rhetoric. I apply the method to collect a data set of Tweets containing violent political rhetoric, spanning the 14-week period surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election. 

Using the data set, I investigate the characteristics and the spread of violent political rhetoric on Twitter. 

The key findings include 

* Users who write violent Tweets are on the fringe of the Twitter network
* Those users are ideologically more extreme and liberal
* Spread of violent Tweets exhibit strong ideological homophily
* Violent Tweets spread through multiple chains on following ties (at least up to three ties)
